My grades are not great, but they aren\\'t terrible either, I\\'m not not fat, but I\\'m not ripped either. But for some reason, for some reason un-fucking-known to me, I can\\'t make friends at all. I try really hard to be social, and make friends. I go to the parties, but always feel uncomfortable, I try to drink and smoke, but hate every second of it. And every time I try to talk to someone, I can feel them looking right through me, looking down on me, and just a look that makes me feel like I would be better off dead.Then Finally, finally I find a group of people who I think want to be friends with me. then, even they start not inviting me to hang out, and they start looking down on me like all the other, and I can\\'t say anything to them because then I just seem like a weak pussy. Yet all I want to do is just scream STOP and to go back to how it used to be. I just feel so trapped, I feel like I can\\'t improve in any sense, I can\\'t get the grades I want, I can\\'t get the body I want, I can\\'t even make the friends I want. Everything I try, ends up in failure. I just feel so fucking trapped and I can see a way out, I can see the way out of it all, just letting it all go, but I just so fucking scared to go... WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO!? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME!? WHY CAN\\'T I BE FUCKING NORMAL!?\\nA: yes\\nQ: [If you\\'re close to killing yourself, there\\'s always one good reason why you shouldn\\'t do it] \\nA: no\\nQ: [I have nothing left to give, and what\\'s left is an empty shell.] I am not good enough at anything to be able to get a job doing anything I actually enjoy.By the time I might be good enough at something, there will be at least 753 more people who are stillbetter than me.I will never be enough. I will never be good enough to have a job doing something I enjoy.I will never be enough for a girl to be attracted to.I will never have enough skill or ability to make something good or even decent.There is nothing about me that is or ever will be enough.I have had enough.I have tried as hard as I can to live in this world.I have tried as hard as I can to figure out what it is that I want in this world.But anything I want to do is wildly invalid and impractical.And it would not be enough to allow me to survive doing it.In order to make it anywhere in this world, I would have to do something that makes meemotionally and at times physically ill, or at least it would have to be something that drains all senseof individuality I have left.I do not even know who \"I\" am any more. I think I have some ideas what I want to do.But, again, those things that I might want to do are all things that are not worth following because theywill never allow me to support myself and be a productive member of society.So the only way I can support myself and live in this world is to do things that erase any sense of selfand turn me into a cog in the machine or a robot with no soul.I just want to be in the world and make people laugh and make them happy.That is all I have ever wanted in this world.But that is something I will never be able to do.I see no reason to continue living.I will never be able to do something that makes me happy because anything I try to do or makewill never be enough. It will not be good enough, nor will it be funny enough.None of my efforts are worthwhile.I do not want to continue fighting the unwinnable fight.I know that there is \"The Impossible Dream\" motivation, but that is not enough.Because, again, I will never be enough.I will not ever be enough.Nothing I will ever make will be enough.There is no point in continuing the struggle.I have tried as hard as I possibly could. I have done everything I could think of.But even then I could not do enough.There is no point.There is nothing left.I am finished.\\nA: yes\\nQ: [Probably gonna swallow the pills soon] I don\\'t really know what to say. I feel like I should go to the hospital but I don\\'t feel like I should unless I actually hurt myself. It\\'s silly you know? People go to suicide wards for attempts, not for saying they\\'re suicidal. But this is not the point. I feel like I have no reason to live. I want to see what death is like. I feel so bad these days that I can\\'t even look forward to the things I used to. I\\'m transgender and face harassment constantly. My fianc√© doesn\\'t approve of me being polysexual because I figured out that I was in the middle of the relationship, he is insisting on keeping the relationship monogamous. I used to tell myself that if I ever felt like death was the only option that I would run away and enjoy myself by camping forever. I don\\'t even see a purpose to that now either. I\\'m only a few days from graduating high school and I don\\'t even care. I am supposed to move to asheville with my fianc√© and attend college. I was so excited and now I just feel trapped and like there isn\\'t even a purpose any more. I think I\\'m gonna take all of my meds (lamictal, Zoloft, and seroquil) and see if that works. I think while I fall asleep forever that I will listen to the unicorns \"who will cut our hair when we\\'re gone?\" Album. I don\\'t know why I\\'m posting here. I don\\'t know what else to do. I can\\'t tell anyone else.\\nA: yes\\nQ: [I\\'m 20 years old and i have an acceptance of death and I feel alone all of the time] I\\'ve felt for a long time that id be completely okey with dying. Like just stopping life and in a weird figurative sort of way finally being able to take a breath. I\\'ve been alone for a long time. Not in the sense that people aren\\'t around me, but in the sense that I\\'m se luring from said people. I used to have a girlfriend of nearly 3 years but I ended it (about 3 months ago) because I didn\\'t want to have any ends in the event that I off\\'d myself. I\\'m dating a new girl that\\'s pretty cool. I have friends that I am close with but even after all of this I still always feel alone and wish to fucking God that this feeling will leave me. I keep trying some of the advice I\\'ve looked into but it\\'s all temporary fixes. I\\'ve been feeling like this for too damn long and don\\'t think it\\'s worth it anymore.\\nA: no\\nQ: [I want someone to talk to] I feel like a pathetic asshole asking for this but I know I need to I\\'ve been drinking tonight and going back and forth I know I\\'m not going to do anything but I also want to feel like someone gives a shit and I don\\'t feel like I have anyone I can really depend on my friends are not people I feel like I can rely on 100% and my family I don\\'t want to burden with my pain I just want someone to listen and I don\\'t care if they really care or not but I want to feel like someone does care ... I\\'m sorry I don\\'t want to burden anyone but when I drink it feels like the only time I have the courage to ask anyone to help me...\\nA: no\\nQ: [I never thought I\\'d have to come back here but...here I am.] For the past almost two years, I was starting to do better. Last week, my 15 month relationship with a great guy ended. I was still having thoughts of wanting to end it and flares of my depression, but I thought I was happy enough that they went away. Now I\\'m here again. My whole body feels heavy and I just want the pain to end, I want me to end. I don\\'t know what to do. If there\\'s someone here, please help me. I don\\'t want to feel like this anymore.\\nA: no\\nQ: [I want to not be alive for the stupidest fucking reason] I\\'ve been living in denial for probably around two years. Now I\\'m no longer in denial, and I just want to stop existing. I don\\'t want to kill myself, God knows I\\'m too much of a bloody coward to do that, but I just want to stop being alive. I want to dress all in black and go out on the highway, hoping someone will bit me. I want to turn on the gas stove and go to bed. I want to get a fake gun and see if a police officer will shoot me. All over a tucking girl. I\\'ve known her for four years, loved her for three and been chasing her for about two. If I die, no one would miss me. I\\'ve lived with the people here for maybe two weeks before they left, they\\'d barely notice a difference. None of my \"friends\" would miss me. No one ever talks to me, I ALWAYS talk to them. I can\\'t remember the last time someone contacted me that I didn\\'t somehow start. I\\'m pretty sure the only thing that girl would think is \"Hey, that fat fuck isn\\'t here anymore.\" Even my parents hate me. I\\'ve got no one. I haven\\'t even had God for a while.And I know what you are going to say. \"She isn\\'t worth it, other fish in the sea,\" and all that crap. I don\\'t believe it. Don\\'t even know why I\\'m posting this. Hell, the only reason anyone would pretend to give a shit is me doing this.\\nA: no\\nQ: [Stressed Out Almost Everyday] I\\'m stressed out. In school, in my home. I don\\'t know what to do. I can\\'t concentrate on my schoolworks. I tried to get rid of the stress. At some point, it went away but after a week or so, I get all stressed again. I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I can\\'t do anything cause of this stress.I feel like the stress is making my life more miserable. I feel like no one will listen to me. My friends stabbed me in the back.

I went into the relationship with the idea she gave me that sex was never a big part of her life, and that it was just a necessary evil she did when she was in relationships.  She had said she only had 3 one-nigh-stands.  I found out recently that that, amongst many other things in our relationship, mostly concerning sex were lies.  I had a melt-down and hurt myself...yes I realize I need help and am clearly not stable if that would do that to me.  She has slept with TONS of guys and has lied about her past and her life so much.  We have talked about marriage and the like in the past...things are serious.  She is a bit older than me, and now I am feeling like the only way I can be ok with things is if I can sleep with other girls, or at least have the permission to.  I\\'m really  in pain and don\\'t need other women or feminists telling me I am a jerk...I know I am and logically I am not a feminist at all, but something inside me is eating away at me, even wanting to slut-shame her.  I thought I was special before with the sex thing but she has been with basically any man that ever wanted to sleep with her.  I don\\'t know what to do...it hurts so much but we\\'re so close and serious. She even said she might be willing to  let me.

I\\'m 33.  It started when my mom passed away about 4 years ago.  I was always closest to my mom.  My dad worked a swing shift job when I was young, I didn\\'t see him much.  If he was home, it was one of those \"Well you need to be quiet because your father is sleeping\" kinda things.  _PERSON_ was the one I could always go to for adviceSince she passed away, I\\'ve become a pretty hardcore alcoholic.  She always did her best to keep me away from alcohol since addiction runs in our family, and I was good.  Drank once or twice a week, never to excessSince she\\'s passed away I can drink a 12 pack a night, probably more if I wanted but I limit myself to that, and other things in my life have gone downhill.  I drink so I just pass out.  If I try to go to sleep, I see things in my sleep...things I don\\'t like.  Things like the faces of my mom, my dad and my older sister disappointed that I\\'ve wasted my life.  I see the faces of my best friends Alex, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, laughing at me because they\\'ve made something for themselves...gotten married, had kids etc...and at 33, I\\'m still pretty much aloneToday I found out I have 10 days to vacate my apartment or I\\'ll be formally evicted.  I\\'m 2 months behind on my rent due to a bad time where I got demoted at work and rent from making roughly $1000 ever 2 weeks to around $450.  If I get evicted, I\\'ll probably be homeless.Awhile back, my older sister said I could stay at her place until I got on my feet.  At this point, getting on my feet would involve paying off the roughly $2500 in back rent, $250 in back cellphone bill, and whatever it takes to fix my truck.  I\\'d bring this up to her, but she\\'s had her own problems.  My niece has had some health issues in recent weeks, and my nephew (her oldest child) is strongly swinging towards Marine boot camp, and I can hear her hold back tears as she talks about that...thge last thing I want to bring on her is \"Hey...you want to take in your loser, homeless brother?\"  Because I know she\\'d do it without hesitation.The more things get worse, the more I think about going to the drug store behind my apartment and getting a bottle of sleeping pills, then going to the liquor store and getting a bottle of whiskey, and just going to sleep.  I\\'ve thought of other ways and that seems to be the best.  I walk to and from work along busy streets, and it would be easy to just \"accidentally\" step in front of a car on the road, but then I\\'d have to deal with my loved ones seeing me like that...so I figure pills and booze is the easiest wayBefore stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I\\'ve made a decision to completely give up alcohol as I was becoming increasingly dangerous to myself when drinking.I need to do something different to get away from everything for a while, but with my options to do so essentially non-existent (I have no vacation time left from work and can\\'t afford to stay in a hotel or go anywhere) I am rapidly running out of alternatives to \\'the ultimate/final alternative\\' (ie suicide)I am typing this from my desk at work and tearing up as I do. My gorgeous fantastic SO, bless her heart, has been trying EVERYTHING to help me and I can see her getting extremely frustrated with me. My friends either refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, or are too busy with their own lives and I don\\'t want to burden them. (I do have one friend who has a wife with depression who is trying to help me and I fully appreciate it, but I don\\'t see the point right now) My family is old-school and refuse to beleive I have any \\'reason\\' to be depressed.My question is, are there such places as mental health hospitals that I can check myself into or be admited to where I can just, I don\\'t know, go stay in a little white room with padded walls for a week and just read books and be away from everything for a little while?Do such places exist and if so are they free to check into or is this something that is expensive and would bankrupt my already financially strapped family like councilling is going to _PERSON_ feel like i\\'m running out of options here and if I don\\'t do something soon I don\\'t know.. but i\\'m starting to scare myself and I don\\'t like it.If anyone can help with my question I would really appreciate it because I have nowhere else to turn.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",
       "  \"The person is expressing feelings of hopelessness, feeling like a burden, and feeling trapped in their current situation. They are also expressing a fear of their own thoughts and a desire to escape their current situation, even if it means being in a mental health hospital. They are not explicitly expressing a desire to die or a plan to end their life, but they are expressing a fear of what might happen if they don't get help soon. This could be interpreted as a form of entrapment, as they feel trapped in their current situation and are struggling to see a way out. However, they are also actively seeking help and exploring options for getting better, which suggests that they have not completely given up hope. Therefore, this is a borderline case, but given the severity of their feelings and their expressed fear of what might happen if they don't get help, it is safer to err on the side of caution and label this as entrapment. \\nA: yes\"),\n",

I quit drinks for 6 months after my GP guaranteed that alcohol was all that stood between me and stability.2) Therapy? All I do is show up and tell positive stories. I\\'ve been working out, I lost weight, I had a threesome the other day. _PERSON_: just how do you get it across to another person that at the end of the day life doesn\\'t feel worth living?You know what, I think maybe there are one or two people in my life whom I \"love\" but that feels a lot more like an obligation than a blessing atm. \"Bring on the nuclear winter!\", I feel, \"at least then I won\\'t be responsible for my loved ones\\' suffering.\"Trapped. \"I have to get out\" sometimes is the only verbal thing going through my head at night. If I think-verbalise the crazy, I suppose, and keep the thoughts to myself that will stop me from acting it out. I often think about killing myself before I fall asleep at night, usually followed by a sense of guilt for all the trouble I\\'ll cause to others. I\\'m waiting for it to build up to such an extent that I don\\'t even think any more, I just do it.I\\'ve honestly considered that my life\\'s destiny is a choice between killing myself and committing a bank robbery with a fake bomb just so I can be caught and be imprisoned.Edit: Fuck. Thank you to people who have replied. However, I\\'m finding that I don\\'t actually have any satisfactory replies for you in turn, so this exercise is really depressing for me. Or it was ok. I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t want to disappoint anyone and I think I\\'m crazy and destined to die early, goodnight.EditEdit:  I can imagine a life where I might actually spend my time saving lives like you people. Or doing things that I love, just finding things to love. I have a picture of that. I\\'ve a good sense of time, too: 17 minutes jogging today, no more no less. Both my watch and brain confirmed it. I spend more than 5 hours a day just thinking about what to do. If I should do. If I can do. What am I doing?EditEditEdit:  When are you supposed to call the Emergency Line (911 or 999)? They say to do that whenever I\\'ve feeling suicidal, but then I\\'d be calling it very often.

If I could guarantee it would be painless and sucessful I would do it.I did the one thing I knew I shouldn\\'t have. I let myself hope. I let my guard down and bought into the hope. I feel incredibly stupid. I should have known better. I let myself believe that it was possible. Right now my guilt is stronger than my urge to die, but I don\\'t know how much more I can take. My husband is at his wits\\' end. His love for me is so fucking strong, and I feel like a shit for not being mentally healthy. All he wants is for me to be happy, and I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not possible.He thinks I base happiness on things and when I don\\'t get them I freak out. In a small way that\\'s true, but it\\'s only because I see how my life is, and how I want it to be. The problem is, where I want to be is unrealistic. Good things don\\'t happen to me. I was told it would be hard work. But things also have to fall into place. I let myself work hard, through physical pain and even when nobody else was helping. And things just aren\\'t falling into place. It would be better if I wasn\\'t promised that THIS TIME it was real.I\\'m just so sick of getting my hopes up and being disappointed.I just want the pain to stop.The only friend I have wants me to talk to her when I\\'m like this, but I feel horrible. Her life really sucks and mine really doesn\\'t. My brain tells me does. I mean, she should be on _PERSON_ getting a car and a giant pile of cash bad. But she listens to my selfish pettiness and talks me out of suicide. Her life sucks ass, and she still believes in _PERSON_. She wants me to put it in His hands. I don\\'t know what to do. Like I said, I\\'m 90% sure I won\\'t kill myself. I just feel so helpless and alone.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

My family hates me seeing stressing myself out. I just wanna scream and shout!!!!!\\nA: no\\nQ: [Been lonely. Had a friend over last night. She left this morning...] And I have literally lost all motivation to do anything again. We didn\\'t sleep much, so I fell asleep on the couch again once she left, but then couldnt motivate myself to do anything for the rest of the day. All I\\'ve done today is lay in bed. I\\'m just really sad. I haven\\'t had a friend over in ages before last night and now I\\'m back to being a lonely emotional wreck.\\nA: no\\n\\nQ: [I just can\\'t stand being worthless anymore] Ever since middle school, I never fit in. Anytime I\\'ve remotely showed interest in anyone, I\\'ve been flat out rejected. That was before I came out. And now, I\\'m in college, and it just has gotten worse and worse and I can\\'t take it anymore.I\\'ve never dated anyone, and no one has ever showed interest in me. I guess I\\'m just so fucking ugly and unattractive that no one wants to go near me. I just don\\'t get it. Literally since age 13 I\\'ve always been the odd one out. No boyfriend/girlfriend, my first kiss was last year at age 20.Last year one of my coworkers told me that one of her residents (we are RA\\'s) thought I was cute. Never in my life has anyone ever described me as attractive, cute or hot or anything remotely positive. The sheer excitement and joy that I got was indescribable. It took a whole semester before I talked to the guy because I was so shy. He messaged me on Grindr and eventually gave me his number. We probably hung out once and he immediately went in for sex.I wasn\\'t ready. I don\\'t think I operate like that. I hate the way my body looks and I just couldn\\'t keep going with him and told him no. He immediately left my room, and I cried my eyes out. How fucking embarrassing.After the spring semester, we got to know each other a little more, in the most minimalist sense. I always wanted to hang out, he always just wanted to hook up, and would often leave after we got physical. I\\'m still a virgin, but I\\'ve hooked up with him a couple of times and I started to crush really hard. This year, probably more than 3/4 of the time when I text him he ignores me, but then when I see him in person acts like everything is great, and then says things like \"we should hang out\". I just don\\'t know what to fucking do. This spring semester I keep seeing this other guy (who is probably gay) writing all over his facebook wall and him liking his posts and whatnot. I just figured he\\'s found someone who isn\\'t worthless like I am and probably is having a great time with him.I\\'m so sick of being alone, I\\'m so sick of feeling worthless. I just don\\'t feel like I fit in, even in the gay culture of hook ups and everything. I\\'ve been frustrated with this guy for the past year and just can\\'t get anywhere with figuring out what he wants/what we are/get closure on it. I knew he had a reputation, as pretty much every gay at my University, of sleeping around. I\\'m just so fucking envious that I can\\'t fit in like that.So then I go out on a limb tonight and message someone on grindr who I thought was attractive. He also has a reputation, but I just wanted to try. I\\'ve never messaged anyone on grindr because I know they are just going to ignore or block me, I\\'m just so fucking unattractive.He messages back, I get excited that I don\\'t respond for like an hour, but then ask a simple question like \"what are you studying\"? Then I sat there for 30 minutes watching him being online the whole time, and then he fucking blocks me. Why the fuck would he respond if he were just going to block me? And what the fuck did I do wrong? Why is my life always like this and why can\\'t I just find someone to be with? I\\'m just so fucking worthless.When I noticed that he blocked me, I just cried my eyes out. I fucking cut both of my wrists and now have blood all over my hands. I\\'m sick of being alone, I\\'m sick of being unattractive, I\\'m sick of being worthless, and I\\'m sick of not being able to do anything about it. Why the fuck was I born like this.

I\\'ll start with some back story and copy something I wrote recently;Few months back, I was admitted to hospital and put on a high dose of steroids as my crohn\\'s had flared up. It was a pretty lonely time and stuff, but I was dealing with it. Rang me once whilst I was there, was drunk and it was 1AM. Basically saying he loves me and what have you.Fast forward a few days, didn\\'t hear back from him. Tried to call his phone but he turned it off. Didn\\'t come on Skype either. Didn\\'t even call on valentines day.Then finally he turns up on Skype about a week later, but to blame his inactivity on \"being skint\". I flipped, said it was selfish and just said I\\'ll talk to him another time, as he was being outright rude and disgustingly brutal. All what he replied with was \"No, you won\\'t, we\\'re done. :)\". He never called or texted me again.Shortly after I was diagnosed with Primary _PERSON_, and at the same time he was trying to hook up with people on dating sites.All in all I\\'m having nightmares, getting the shakes and daily suicidal thoughts. I\\'m also on _PERSON_ (20mg) along with _PERSON_ which isn\\'t helping anything. I feel stupid, numb and dumb, and now struggle with conversations. My health is stopping me from being the person I once was, and without it I\\'m lost.I\\'m scared of myself at this point, and shaking as I write this.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

Went to school for a year, dropped out in the beginning of the 2nd year because of suicidal thoughts. Came home, got a job(shitty, shitty job) and connected with high school friends. It definitely got better, but I think I\\'ve kind of reach a point where I\\'m done recovering and need to do something with my life.My dad talks to me tonight because I\\'ve been really down lately, and basically just tries to get me to do something. Without him really knowing it I guess, he makes me realize how much I hate my life. I don\\'t want to go to school for something I don\\'t enjoy, which is kind of what he wants, i.e. more focused on getting a job I don\\'t enjoy but pays well. I want to go back to school for something mildly interesting to me like a foreign language, but don\\'t know what the hell I\\'d do with it. My future looks pretty bleak. I am a smart kid, I just have no direction or drive.He says what are you doing socially? Are there any girls you\\'re interested in? Of course there are. I have an easier time speaking in foreign languages that I\\'ve never encountered than talking to girls. I can\\'t do it. It\\'s fucking depressing. I just tell people girls don\\'t like me. My social life is pretty much limited to smoking weed with friends, soccer, and the occasional party. Nothing much.I just feel like I don\\'t have much to live for. This life is OK I guess, but if i\\'m gonna be forced to get a job I don\\'t enjoy, be lonely, and have an uneventful life I think I\\'d rather just kill myself. If it weren\\'t for my family I think I would have already. I don\\'t know what to do with my life.

I don\\'t have any major problems (financial, relationship or anything else really).

Honestly if i had a choice to not have been born or to die in my sleep tonight I\\'d take it. I have tried killing myself before (helium) but failed because of 1 tiny mistake. Im apathetic to how my family would feel if I did it. I guess the real reason why I wanna do it is because of my outlook on life, which is: life is filled with ups and downs(for most people including me) and I guess Im too lazy to deal with the responsibilities of an adult, to me I\\'d rather just be \"asleep\" forever.

Please don\\'t judge.] I really don\\'t know what I can do. I\\'ve felt like this for a while now, but I don\\'t know if I want to keep going. The most I can ask for is that someone listens. I\\'m 17 and I finished my Senior year of High School 1 year early. I\\'m the middle child and the only boy. Starting when I was about 5 (I cannot quite remember the age, I just remember I was really young) I would go to my friends house across the street of my grandmas to play the Ocarina of Time and YuGiOh, it was fun from what I remember but what I didn\\'t realize is that my friend was making me do inappropriate things to one kid, and he also sexually abused me in a way. He\\'d bring his friend over from around the block, and pull his pants down. He\\'d make me touch his friend and he\\'d do things do him too. Eventually he would watch porn and make me touch him. He removed my pants and did things to me too. I don\\'t remember what happened but I just kinda stopped going over there. Its a blur. Then a year or two later the kid down the street from my house who is a year younger than me convinced me into sexual activity under my bed. Of course I didn\\'t know this was wrong considering I was so young. I guess everyone experiments. Even the kid a few houses down that was way older than me got involved. Once I realized what we were doing was wrong I took myself out of the equation, and that has stuck with me since. Around the same time this was happening my dad started drinking more and became physically abusive towards me exclusively as i\\'m the middle child and the only boy my parents had. He couldn\\'t beat my sisters so I guess I was the outlet. He would yell at me and throw me against a fence. Sometimes he would throw chairs at me and kick me in the head, sometimes he would punch me. He stomped my chest one time when I was watching Pokemon in the morning when I was around 10. He kept this up until I was 15 and then we moved. It was supposed to be a fresh start for the family but my dad is still a drinker, and he verbally abuses me on a constant basis. He makes inquiries that i\\'m gay when I really don\\'t know what my sexuality is. I don\\'t think I will know, its very foggy to me considering the events i\\'ve detailed. This is the first time i\\'ve told anyone about this. In school a gay kid (he came out) started rumors that I was gay too. The rumor\\'s continued from middle school even through my junior year. No action was ever taken against the kids who kept making fun of me. One time a girl tried to take a metal pen and scratch gay in capitals into my arm, so I grabbed the pen off my desk and just flung my arm back, it caught her in the eye. I got in more trouble than she did, eventually in Intermediate we became friends though. The kid who started the rumors never apologized to me, he used to be my close friend. My little cousin approached me one day and started touching me inappropriately and I didn\\'t know what to do, I was in shock. I hate thinking about these things, but it is was my childhood was and I don\\'t know what to do with my life.I\\'ve been rejected by almost every girl i\\'ve spoken too despite them leading me on. I try and take my mind off these things by playing video games, watching movies/tv, and reading comics, but I don\\'t know how l long I can do this for. My parents haven\\'t prepared me to leave out on my own, my dad wont fix my car or buy me a new one, and without that I cannot get a job. They are trying to pressure me into a job and college, but I don\\'t know what I wanna do, and i\\'m not ready to get a job. We moved a year ago and this new house doesn\\'t really feel like home.I feel like I\\'m not going to be around for much longer.

I fantasized about so many ways of dying , throwing myself  out of a tall building , hanging myself from an electricalpole .I thought i was done , I had nothing else to offer. The suffering was overwhelming and ever present.I was only comfortable sleeping , when i woke up I suffered from either anedhonia or profound sadness.I had the deepest depression of my life , I was ready to meet my maker , I didn\\'t fear death for once i hungered for it.I lusted for it , I wanted it so much.But then i met the most wonderful person , this person brought life into my life , this person made me feel special and wanted and needed .This person told me \"I love you\" . This person told me i was awesome and i meant the world to this person.We have everything in common , we make each other fell good and happy , when we are together I feel i can do anything.I have the confidence and the fortitude i lacked and i fell happy for once in my life.Just some food for thought guys , if I had killed myself I wound NOT have felt this happiness and warmth .

I\\'ve never really been here before, but I need your advice concerning a friend.] I really hope this is the right place for this.. Here goes. Note: the friend in question lives 1500 miles away, before anyone asks.As I run over the events of tonight, I keep feeling worse about it. A friend of mine has had a pretty rough life the last few years. Let me preface this by saying she does not trust people and hardly lets anyone in. Two years ago she was held hostage in her own home as they were robbed and things with her (now ex) boyfriend started to sour because she was unable to cope with the robbery. Eventually they ended up breaking up a year later. After this happened she started to slip into darkness; she had suicidal thoughts and actions. The only person she ever really loved threw her out. She and I were not in touch at this point because she made a kind of crazy agreement with him that she would not talk to other guys if he agreed not to talk to other girls. (She was quite the jealous type.)Fast forward to more recent times. She was doing better, but definitely not doing well. She had made progress, but she still wasn\\'t completely normal (whatever that really means). She still pined over her ex, unrealistically hoping that he\\'d take her back even though he made it clear he had no intention of dating her or anyone else for a long time. I tried to do my best as a friend to support her, though I made it clear that she should probably begin to move on. Two to three weeks ago they met and had lunch. Eventually the topic of getting back together came up and he lashed out at her and made it painfully obvious that they would not date. Yet even with this she refused to believe that they wouldn\\'t get back together.Fast forward to last week. After some huge blowout, he finally cut ties completely with her. Needless to say she did not take it well and I ended up having to pick up the pieces. She voiced her desire to kill herself. I tried to talk her down, but when that failed I suggested that she call a suicide hotline. She called and the lady talked her down and she was okay. I got her to see a therapist.Four days ago, the only friend she had left at her university turned her back on her and made it clear that they could never be friends again. My friend doesn\\'t take it well, but she\\'s more angry than anything which is completely reasonable. Immediately after it happens she is bawling her eyes out and crying over the phone as we talked. I let her know that I care about her a lot and that I am there for her and after about forty-five minutes of talking, she\\'s doing much better. She has thoughts of killing herself because she feels alone, but she\\'s able to stifle them with help from her therapist.Okay so, fast forward to tonight. My friend is not able to think rationally. She is a complete wreck. She prefaced our conversation with the statement that she is considering killing herself tonight. At first I just tried to talk her down but there wasn\\'t a shred of rationality in her tonight. A suicide hotline wouldn\\'t even do it. My friend had been cutting herself all night (superficially), citing it is the only way she copes. She said that she had her pills at her side and was cutting more to prepare for tonight.At this point, I decide to call her campus PD. I couldn\\'t live with myself if she had killed herself and I did nothing so I acted. About half an hour later they get to her dorm and talk her down and take her to the psych hospital.I feel like I did the right thing, but I feel like I betrayed her confidence and I keep feeling worse about it as time progresses. But that aside, how am I to help my friend?Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I just want to talk and stuff. Ugh...everything is just so hard. School is very hard for me for some reason and I\\'m probably going to fail. I really hate it. Everyone else seems to be so happy, and I\\'m just the quiet antisocial guy and no one really seems to care about me much there.At home it is really hard because first of all, there are a lot of arguments that go on. That makes me sound weak but it actually affects me. And also my mom likes to make fun of me. She only seems to care about how I do in school. Everyone wants me to \"like and respect\" her but I haven\\'t felt any love or respect for her in years. Everyone thinks that that\\'s bad but they don\\'t know what it\\'s like for me. I overthink and I feel bad about everything. I get anxious whenever I\\'m close to being happy and I think about everything that\\'s wrong and I just start to feel bad. I can\\'t help but worry about everything that happens. I am so unmotivated. I can\\'t do any work or anything. Mostly when I\\'m at home, all I do is lay down in my bed and think and I don\\'t do any work. So it must be my fault because I don\\'t really try, I want to die too much I think.I do have things I like. I have some hobbies like writing and drawing (but I\\'ve been too unmotivated to do either recently). I do have a dream of what I want to do in the future. I have some friends. But maybe those things are becoming less and less effective. The pain is just increasing.I\\'ve decided that the only way out of this constant pain and depression is to die. I wish I didn\\'t have to. The few people that care would be destroyed. And I won\\'t be able to do all the stuff that I like or want to do. So I can somewhat see a point in living. But the thing is, every time I get happy, it always goes away. I just want to be happy like everyone else!! Is that really too much to ask? Do I just deserve to feel bad like this? That\\'s what it\\'s starting to feel like. I\\'m really tired of fighting. I would cry, but for some reason I can\\'t cry anymore. That feels really horrible to have to hold in my feelings like this I really want to just cry and let it all out. I want to get help. I want to talk to people. But I\\'m really antisocial and I can\\'t talk to people and I hate myself for it. And when I do try to talk to people they usually ignore me or forget about me. This is all too much for me‚Ä¶if things don\\'t get better soon I\\'m going to attempt suicide. I just want it all to be over forever. And nothing ever helps. Dying is the only way to make it better. Please convince me otherwise because I don\\'t want to have to do this. I knew this post would be confusing‚Ä¶sorry for being such a burden. You don\\'t have to read all of this, I just care that you listened. Even if you don\\'t read it all or you can\\'t help me with this, thank you so much because you listened and cared.

Yet she still claims she\\'s free to do what she wants until then because I broke up with her, and didn\\'t want to get back together while she still wanted to. Now I just keep praying that something will happen.. maybe the prop will start inadvertently whilst I\\'m inspecting it, or who knows.

And every time I try to talk to someone, I can feel them looking right through me, looking down on me, and just a look that makes me feel like I would be better off dead.Then Finally, finally I find a group of people who I think want to be friends with me. then, even they start not inviting me to hang out, and they start looking down on me like all the other, and I can\\'t say anything to them because then I just seem like a weak pussy. Yet all I want to do is just scream STOP and to go back to how it used to be. I just feel so trapped, I feel like I can\\'t improve in any sense, I can\\'t get the grades I want, I can\\'t get the body I want, I can\\'t even make the friends I want. Everything I try, ends up in failure. I just feel so fucking trapped and I can see a way out, I can see the way out of it all, just letting it all go, but I just so fucking scared to go...

My fianc√© doesn\\'t approve of me being polysexual because I figured out that I was in the middle of the relationship, he is insisting on keeping the relationship monogamous. I used to tell myself that if I ever felt like death was the only option that I would run away and enjoy myself by camping forever. I don\\'t even see a purpose to that now either. I\\'m only a few days from graduating high school and I don\\'t even care. I am supposed to move to asheville with my fianc√© and attend college. I was so excited and now I just feel trapped and like there isn\\'t even a purpose any more. I think I\\'m gonna take all of my meds (lamictal, Zoloft, and seroquil) and see if that works.

Not in the sense that people aren\\'t around me, but in the sense that I\\'m se luring from said people. I used to have a girlfriend of nearly 3 years but I ended it (about 3 months ago) because I didn\\'t want to have any ends in the event that I off\\'d myself. I\\'m dating a new girl that\\'s pretty cool. I have friends that I am close with but even after all of this I still always feel alone and wish to fucking God that this feeling will leave me.

Last week, my 15 month relationship with a great guy ended. I was still having thoughts of wanting to end it and flares of my depression, but I thought I was happy enough that they went away. Now I\\'m here again. My whole body feels heavy and I just want the pain to end, I want me to end. I don\\'t know what to do. If there\\'s someone here, please help me. I don\\'t want to feel like this anymore.\\nA: no\\nQ: [I want to not be alive for the stupidest fucking reason] I\\'ve been living in denial for probably around two years. Now I\\'m no longer in denial, and I just want to stop existing. I don\\'t want to kill myself, God knows I\\'m too much of a bloody coward to do that, but I just want to stop being alive. I want to dress all in black and go out on the highway, hoping someone will bit me. I want to turn on the gas stove and go to bed. I want to get a fake gun and see if a police officer will shoot me. All over a tucking girl. I\\'ve known her for four years, loved her for three and been chasing her for about two. If I die, no one would miss me. I\\'ve lived with the people here for maybe two weeks before they left, they\\'d barely notice a difference. None of my \"friends\" would miss me. No one ever talks to me, I ALWAYS talk to them. I can\\'t remember the last time someone contacted me that I didn\\'t somehow start. I\\'m pretty sure the only thing that girl would think is \"Hey, that fat fuck isn\\'t here anymore.\" Even my parents hate me. I\\'ve got no one. I haven\\'t even had God for a while.And I know what you are going to say. \"She isn\\'t worth it, other fish in the sea,\" and all that crap. I don\\'t believe it.

In school, in my home. I don\\'t know what to do. I can\\'t concentrate on my schoolworks. I tried to get rid of the stress. At some point, it went away but after a week or so, I get all stressed again. I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I can\\'t do anything cause of this stress.I feel like the stress is making my life more miserable. I feel like no one will listen to me. My friends stabbed me in the back. My family hates me seeing stressing myself out. I just wanna scream and shout!!!!!\\nA: no\\nQ: [Been lonely. Had a friend over last night. She left this morning...] And I have literally lost all motivation to do anything again. We didn\\'t sleep much, so I fell asleep on the couch again once she left, but then couldnt motivate myself to do anything for the rest of the day. All I\\'ve done today is lay in bed. I\\'m just really sad. I haven\\'t had a friend over in ages before last night and now I\\'m back to being a lonely emotional wreck.\\nA: no\\n\\nQ: [I am a failure.] Grades just came in for the end of the semester and I barely passed one class, got two Cs and I failed a class.  This really hurts.  I am at an all time low.  If I can\\'t get my GPA up to a 2.0 by the end of next semester I face dismissal.  I am extremely embarrassed by this.  I can\\'t face my parents.  My boss noticed I was feeling really low today at work and asked whats wrong.  I couldn\\'t say why so I just made something up.  I do and I don\\'t want to go back in the fall.  I am starting to think of transferring to a community college for the time being.  I just feel terrible and the lowest I\\'ve ever felt ever.  At work today I contemplated suicide.  Various times throughout the day I did.  It just haunts me.  I don\\'t want to be kicked out of school because I can\\'t get my shit together.  I keep questioning what I am I doing and what I want.  I\\'m starting to think that College isn\\'t the best thing for me to be doing right now.  I don\\'t know how to tell my parents about this.  I just don\\'t know.  I don\\'t want depression to be some lame excuse why I didn\\'t go to college.  It just hurts.  I can\\'t do anything right ever.  I feel like I\\'ll never amount to anything good ever.  I\\'ll just be some slob who takes out your groceries at the store and never will amount to anything.  If I don\\'t make it through college I\\'ll break the line of everyone in my family and extended family to fail and not completed college.  So much damn pressure so much damn stress it just makes my depression worse and I am afraid to seek help.  I don\\'t know why I am afraid to look and ask for help.  Even now I think about killing my self.  I just hate everything about myself.  I am such a fuck up.  I can\\'t do anything right.

One day they are here, then you get a phone call. It\\'s just surreal.I guess what I\\'m here to say is that yea, this holiday season can be brutal for some people.  I understand that well, I don\\'t have much in the way of family and you really notice how alone you are when everyone else is talking about how they got this for their wife, their parents, their kids, their brothers and nephews and nieces and all their plans and then they ask what are YOU doing for the holidays? And you say \"I dunno\".I\\'m very lucky to have some good friends. This year I\\'ll be spending Christmas day with my friend and his family when they get home from Church.

However, I do not know where else I can post this:A few years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD: during the severe stages I would stay awake for hours panicking about the collapse of society and chaos. It has been treated and now it is more manageable beyond the occasional minor attack.However, a developed a method of coping with my panic attacks, only one that seemed to work completely. A lot of my fears and anxiety comes from the lack of control: that the future is uncertain and death could come at any time, that I could be stuck in some depressing future.So I realised that I could just kill myself if things went bad enough. And it worked as an idea: somehow it gave me back control. That if eventually my death will be at my own hands then I don\\'t need to fear anything else.I can\\'t find anything about people doing this, just wanted to know if I was alone in this.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I know I could\\'ve gotten into a better one if I studied harder in school, but I guess I\\'m just retarded because I\\'m ruining my life on purpose. I have a friend who I usually live with, but now we are on holidays so I had to move back to my parents. I wake up everyday with no desire to live and do something. The only thing that keeps me alive is internet and cigarettes. I don\\'t talk to my parents because we simply don\\'t have anything to talk about. I had a dream this year - to move to a better country for studying, but now it\\'s completely gone because my father\\'s salary got cut and he cannot afford it. I used to tell myself that everything is going to be okay, but now it\\'s just hard to believe. And also my country is at war (Ukraine) so I guess everyone is kinda depressed now, but I can\\'t take it anymore. I\\'m still not sure if I want to kill myself or just pack a bag and take off.

For a long time I have wanted to just die, and the only thing that\\'s keeping me here is that I cannot stand the thought of my mum crying over my corpse. I am full of self hatred, insecurities, baggage and a complete fear of the world. My friends don\\'t care enough about me to stay engaged in any conversation, hell, almost all of them don\\'t even live within distance to see them and now I just feel lonely all the time.This entire revelation came about minutes ago, when I was sitting in bed and my mind wandered back to all the shit people have put me through. My entire school experience was one long line of people who wanted to bully and harass me. My first girlfriend cheated on me with her \"_PERSON_ best friend who she had no feelings for, my second girlfriend emotionally abused me and bullied me for wanted her to treat me like her boyfriend and my third girlfriend, who often told me that she had never loved anyone the way she loved me, dumped me a week ago and was already in the arms of another guy the next day.I don\\'t know what it is about me that makes people want to be terrible to me, but I cannot deal with it any more, I really really just can\\'t. I\\'ve been suffering from depression for my entire life and I think that my time is over when I have no one left who would cry when I die.So I don\\'t know what the point of this post is really. I guess I just want to get it all out somewhere that I won\\'t be called an idiot for being depressed. I\\'ve sat for hours and tried to think of the positive moments of my life, but all that ever comes to me is more bullying and awful moments that make me feel worse and worse about life. I don\\'t see there being a silver lining, I can\\'t even operate like a normal person because the world terrifies me. My lifes dream is to just have a family and be surrounded by people who love me, but my depression, social fears, distrust and emotional problems have made that dream completely unlikely.I dunno, I guess I\\'m just saying that I don\\'t want to live and don\\'t see a point in trying any more.Edit: Thanks for downvoting me guys.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I contemplated killing myself for awhile. I loved at home with my family but I broke my ties with them after major disagreements. Living with him is my last resort. I crave love and affection,  I feel so alone. I feel my baby kick and I want to end her life.  Debating if I should take hers alone or mine along with her.  It\\'s only going to get worse.  I moved out of my city, I quit my job,  I lost my only family,  I had to get rid if my pet because my ex hates animals and I\\'m living with this jerk. I\\'m tired of hysterically crying and my feelings being undermined like I\\'m crazy.  I\\'m not crazy, I\\'m alone in this darkness. The bastard says he\\'s not in love with me.

He (a FtM transgender; I\\'m an otherwise cishet male) was in a theatre performance in our hometown where he still lives for now, so I came to see it as I promised I would a while ago.We haven\\'t spoken in three weeks. Three Fridays ago we left on a sour note after he canceled plans we had to get breakfast last-minute. Besides the small spat the cancellation caused, we\\'d been on solidly good terms for several weeks. A couple days later I sent him a text while I was playing a trivia game with some friends. A question came up and I knew the answer, but only because it was something he had told me a long time ago when we were still together.Since then I\\'ve half-deliberately avoided any contact. We\\'ve both been busy -- him with theatre, me with school, and both of us with life in general. I had hoped tonight would be a refreshing moment, because when last we spoke I think we both would have called ourselves great close friends still.I went to see him when the show was over after saying hey to a few other people I knew there. He came and offered a hug, which I returned. And the feelings rushed back into me again. Things I hadn\\'t felt in a while and that I thought were all but gone. And the thing about the hug was that I could tell that he felt nothing similar. I tried to convey my excitement and happiness for his performance, but it felt ill-received as I was kinda pushed aside.I thought I was past this. I\\'ve gone out with and chatted up several other people in the past few weeks. I felt like I was over him, like I was whole again, y\\'know? But after tonight, I\\'m not so certain.I generally run pretty low, emotionally speaking. Suicide is an almost daily consideration of mine. I have a necklace with a charm that means a lot to me that I wear when I need an extra boost to get through my day. I haven\\'t taken it off, outside of showering, in almost a month. I keep poking my thumb on its pointed end to make sure it still hurts. All I can think of is taking the pointed end somewhere else on my skin and just letting it destroy me. I\\'m not trying to sound poetic to make a statement, but writing has always been one of my coping mechanisms.In regards to my ex, I feel like I still want to be with him more than anything. If we can manage to just be best friends, that\\'s okay, too, especially since we\\'d been just that for a couple of months without many complications.No one has ever known or understood me -- my passions, my dreams, my quirks, or my pain -- like he has/did. And at this moment, I\\'m still honestly convinced that nobody ever will.I want to die. I want to be done with all of this. Knowing that he either can\\'t or simply won\\'t be here to stop me, I want to disappear that much more.Please. If you\\'ve read this far and have any real and sincere advice to offer, I\\'m open to suggestions.Thanks for listening, Reddit.

My mother is a very religious woman, but I\\'m not. She grounded me for 2 months for having sex. I had no contact with my girlfriend and life just seemed so dull. Fast foward to now where my mom installs cameras in my house to make sure I\\'m not with my girlfriend or anyone for that matter. This has affected her and I to the point where both of us are cutting almost everynight. I\\'ve told my mom about it and she told me that if I ever cut or tried to kill myself again, she would send me to a mental institution. Maybe I sound like a spolied brat thats not getting what he wants, but I just want the things that make me happy. Such as seeing my girlfriend, hanging out with friends, having sex with my girlfriend, and just feeling alive again. It\\'s just hard when your mother thinks you\\'re something wrong, but you know it\\'s right. I want to run away and jump off a bridge. Maybe slit my throat open with a razor.

Lately I\\'ve felt so lonely, and watching a couple of friends dropping me to do something else makes me wish the people close to me could value me as much as if I passed away. I feel like the only reason why I haven\\'t considered actually killing myself is because I\\'m a selfish asshole who wants to experience how it feels to be valued. But finding suicide tragically beautiful and researching suicide methods, even out of curiosity, is so dangerous, and I am agonizingly afraid that one day I might tip over and start planning my own death.&amp;nbsp;For the record, I didn\\'t find a method that I liked. All the means of suicide I found were either not symbolic enough for my situation or too slow or painful for me to be satisfied with. And I hope that I never find something I like because if I end up giving up on life, I\\'ll be so much closer to death if I know how I want to go.&amp;nbsp;As a side note, I should\\'ve probably used a throwaway to post this.

In another post I read something along the lines of, \"Even if you don\\'t have a **legitimate** reason to be depressed, remember that it\\'s completely normal to have thoughts of killing yourself.\"What?Okay, look. I know everyone here just wants to help. That\\'s great. Amazing, in fact. Reddit is such a great and caring community, and I mean that in the most sincerest of ways. But if you don\\'t truly understand depression I ask you-- no, I *beg* you-- to just stay silent. Offer support in the comments, of course. Ask questions. But do **not** pretend to know what it\\'s like to be depressed and *definitely* don\\'t act like you\\'re a qualified psychologist.It\\'s true that everyone gets depressed from time to time. \"She broke up with me, my life is over!\" or \"My kitteh died, I\\'m so sad!\" are normal \"depressions\" for us all. Clinical depression, however, is an entirely different issue. Just because you\\'ve been sad before does **not** mean you know what true depression is like. And when you try to give \"hope\" to people suffering from it based on that misconception, well, you\\'re doing more harm than good.Clinical depression that leads to suicidal ideation is a very serious psychological disorder. Serious thought of suicide is not normal. The deep hole, the black dog that is clinical depression, is not something one can simply snap their fingers at to get out of. My friends, I know you all mean well. But please, stop making posts that belittle this curse. While I admire the fact that you want to help I feel insulted by many of these recent posts from people who think this is just a game that is limited to only adolescents. I am 30 years old and I have struggled with depression my entire life.Instead, why not just hang out in the comments sections of /r/suicidewatch/new? Just talk to those who are seriously depressed and suicidal. Offer an ear. Give positive feedback.But this recent spate of \"Hey, I was sad yesterday because my dog died but now I\\'m happy! You can be, too!\" posts need to stop. If you haven\\'t suffered from true clinical depression, you have no idea what it\\'s like. And shame on you for pretending that you do because you\\'re hurting the cause, not helping it.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I\\'m sick of life and I have been feeling this way for 3 years.] Hi.  I\\'m a teenage male.  My name is Reece.I have been suffering from severe clinical depression for at least 3 years, maybe longer, probably longer.  I cut myself a lot.  I actually just relapsed after being clean for 9 months.  9 fucking months, thrown away.  I met a girl about a year and a half ago that always helps me through everything, and just over 9 months ago I asked her out (because her and I were honestly almost 100% similar) and she said yes.  I asked her just before I stopped cutting and she stopped around the same time too.  She\\'s still strong and hasn\\'t had even a thought of self harm again, but I just started doing it again about a week ago and she doesn\\'t know yet.  I did it for a while before we were together too, she thinks I haven\\'t done it since then.Anyway. _PERSON_ with the relationship stuff.She\\'s really the only person that cares, and I ALWAYS feel I am bothering her or annoying her whenever I am telling her about how I feel.  Every single time.  There is only one other person I can talk to and I also feel I bother this person.  I often just sit alone and keep everything to myself.  I feel ugly, I feel annoying, I feel unwanted, I feel alone, I know I let everyone down, I hate myself, and so on.  I have felt this way for so long, I can\\'t even remember.  No one supports me at all.  Everyone in my school either avoids me or says something about how I should go kill myself or how I am a faggot or whatever.  That really doesn\\'t help.  I have terrible anxiety and terrible trust issues.  I hurt everyone around me due to that.  My parents and brother don\\'t know about this, they thought I just had minor issues in the past.  They all know I used to cut, but again, none of them know I relapsed.  They all think I am happy and they all think I am doing better, but I\\'m not.  I can\\'t remember the last time I was truly happy.  Whenever I feel a little better or I feel decent, there is always something that will fuck it up.  Every single time.  Someone says something, someone does something, whatever.  Literally every time there is something to ruin my \"happiness\".  I put on a fake smile every single day.  No one knows that. _PERSON_ of people try to communicate with me or say something to me and honestly I don\\'t want anything to do with them because they are all fake.  I am told very often I am worthless, people always stare at me awkwardly, I always hear people talking about me, even in public, all of the religious fucks at my school tell me I\\'m going to hell for this and that, I\\'m not really religious at all but that\\'s just annoying.  There are so many people that can say they hate me and I only have two people to ever go to about my problems.  Other people say they will be there but they end up screwing me over.  For example, this one girl I used to be friends with.  I won\\'t say her name.  Her and I would talk to each other often, whenever we were feeling down, and I thought she was a friend.  I later found out she would talk about me behind my back, she would post my secrets on facebook and tumblr and she would spread everything, she would lie to me about a lot, you get it.  That\\'s happened a few times, actually.  I only trust my girlfriend.  Only her, no one else.  I\\'ve been taken advantage of, I\\'ve been beaten up, you name it.  _PERSON_ guys have tried to rape me, for fuck\\'s sake.  I am often told by people that somehow found out about my issues (probably from that girl I just mentioned) and they say it\\'s all a lie because I\\'m not a girl.  They think only girls can be sad and cut themselves and starve themselves, they are so fucking blind.  I could go on and on about these people.  Anyone who says they are here for me is a big fucking liar.  No one else that I call a \"friend\" even has the slightest idea of how I am.  I could go on and on and on about my shitty life, but I think I will stop soon.  I have left a lot unsaid.  I haven\\'t had any thoughts or attempts of suicide in a while, but tonight that\\'s different.  I am seriously on edge right now.  I hate this stupid fucking hell that I call my life.  I am seriously going to scream if someone generically says \"oh it will get better\", that\\'s probably the biggest lie I have ever heard.Sorry for the long post.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

Given this info, yes, I contacted CVS stating this...they told me to count immediately and let them know if it is filled correctly. I need a job. Administrative work, please.Since the script wasn\\'t filled correctly, I feel suicidal WITHOUT it. With the medication I am on, there is an increase in hearing voices, seeing shit that isn\\'t there, vomiting/queasy when one is not slowly weaned off it and I am scared to be alone.This being said, this is stuff I was dealing with prior to medication.I spent the weekend with my S/O crying.No job, useless...I should just go home.I just want the pain to stop.I am an introvert. the job wasn\\'t for me, having to be bubbly and smiley. 2 things I have never been. I am an introvert, I do have a pretty smile, but having to pretend it, is sssooo hard.I want to say, \"Fuck that lady that let me go,\" but it is her business, it\\'s a startup, she knows what sort of people she would like to employ.Was it racism? who knows?Why couldn\\'t I just be normal.I feel vomity.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I still want to, and I am planning to do it.] To be blunt, I find the act of living to be horrible.  In my experience people are not nice to each other, and are most commonly plain abusive. I was sexually assaulted as a child by a woman hired to take care of me. Because I\\'m a man I\\'ve been told that this actually isn\\'t possible because of my gender, and also told to stop using the word rape to describe the experience. I\\'ve been told this people who supposedly love me.My first suicide attempt was in grade school and was on campus.  I was using a knife and was working up the courage for a particularly deep cut.  When a teacher caught me I begged not to be sent home.  I was sent home without delay.  When my parents found out what I had done I was sent to my room, and told to do my homework. No one asked why I did it.My next serious attempt was in freshman year of high school. I had transferred schools hoping that that one change would make my life somehow better. It did not. Once again I was trying to exsanguinate myself.  I knew I couldn\\'t do suffocation or choking as I had tried those and my survival instincts were too hard to suppress.  This time I was sent to the school counselor once I was caught, and was then hospitalized.Shortly before freshman year of university I made my next attempt by poisoning. My significant other made abusive comments about my sexuality and I allowed myself to internalize them into a redefinition of my self worth. In addition to poisoning I sat in a car in the garage with the engine on hoping to get carbon monoxide poisoning.  My sister caught me asking what I was doing. I lied saying I had lost something in the car and was trying to find it.  Later my significant other asked what was wrong and I admitted that I had swallowed two entire bottles of pain pills.  Once again I was hospitalized.I later married her.  On one hand she says abusive things, or did at that time. On another hand she saved my life and professed to love me.Over the next ten years we remained married, and between us there has been at least three attempts for one person or another to die.  I\\'ve lost count and it all blends together in my head.  Suffice to say things have not gone smoothly, and I know we are not healthy.I have had to promise and vow and swear over and over again to other people to not kill myself.  I feel like I\\'m held captive my life and I want to escape it. I\\'m convinced that a change of circumstance such as a different job or a divorce would not change this outlook.  I am convinced that everywhere I go everyone will still be abusive to each other and prop themselves up by belittling each other making each other miserable.I hate life.  All life is is the unending struggle to stay alive and it always ends with death.  So why not skip the struggle and just get to the ending?Edit: I am thinking strongly of using a credit card to rent a storage bin big enough for myself and my car, parking in it, leaving the engine on and the window down, and then taking a boatload of pills. Then I could lie back, fall asleep, and just never wake up.  Then this whole mess called life would finally be over.  Out of fear of living through it though I could just be extra thorough and simultaneously exsanguinate. This is the most difficult part for me so I\\'d likely resort instead to suffocation or ligature compression, or make the cut after taking a series of blood thinners so that it is less painful and more successful.  My main concern is having someone find my body after rescue is impossible but to still be found.  I guess this is important to me for the sentimental reason that I don\\'t want anyone to think that I just dissapeared or leave them with some belief that I\\'m alive out there somewhere.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

It\\'s up to the halls to decide if they think I able to look after myself at uni. If I can\\'t go back I\\'ve planned to either jump in front of a train, or if I chicken out at the tracks, death by dehydration. I can\\'t tell anyone this or else they\\'ll think I\\'ll do something stupid when I\\'m at uni and won\\'t let me back. I only want one week at uni.

I remember and I wonder, did she walk off into the woods that night to overdose in peace, did he hang himself in his basement, did he jump from the top of those offices and did she walk away into the cold to never be seen again? Did these people go through with it or where they persuaded otherwise, did they succeed and did they find the peace and release they wanted?For the most part, we rarely learn your names, we are usually only left to remember your reddit username and even then, this is one of the only things we know about you. I will be honest, I do not actually remember your usernames for I see so many everyday but I do remember you guys. I think about you often and I just hope that you did find the peace you went to seek. I hope that you found what you were looking for, or something better. If you are still with us, I hope you found that epiphany instead, the one so many of us are fortunate enough to have, and I hope you learned what you have to live for.But for those of you who came here to say goodbye, I do respect you all so much. In reading your words, I am pleased to know that you had thought it through and though you were wanting to end the pain, you did it for the happiness that peace would bring - you knew what you were doing and truly wanted it and were not just doing it out of desperation on the instance of of a thought.I just want you guys to know that, though we may not know, or remember, your names, we do think of you often. You are remembered by those that did not know you and truly missed by those who did. You were remembered and all of you always will be. Good luck to everyone reading this and to the memories of those who no longer can. See you in another life, brother.This is for those who helped to save others. This is for those who could not be saved. This is for those who may need saving. This is for those who are reading this. This is for those who are not. This is for those who no longer can.

I was very miserable the whole time I was at work, and if I had an \"_PERSON_\" - a button that I could press which would kill me instantly and painlessly, I would have pressed it with no hesitation. It\\'s not like I had nothing to do with work: I was actually working too slowly and the work was piling up.Came home and saw my dog just sitting there on the couch, not moving at all, business as usual. I love my dog more than anything in the world. Seeing this just made me more depressed and reinforced my belief in life being over-rated.I\\'m not so bored now (browsing the web), but I would still hit that _PERSON_ if I could. I\\'d say right now I\\'m slightly bored, I could play some video games to entertain me, but I\\'ve got other shit to take care of.The only real obstacle to me committing suicide right now is that I don\\'t have the means to. I have some kitchen knives that I can use to slit my carotid artery but I\\'m too afraid of pain. I heard having your heart stop beating is a nice way to die, you just lose consciousness and eventually you\\'re gone.

So naturally i\\'m tired of living. It\\'s boring. There\\'s nothing in it for me. I am empty. I want help. but at the same time, i feel i can\\'t take anyone\\'s help because I\\'ve never HAD anyone help me. My family tells me to suck it up and ignored my pleas to go to therapy.

I\\'m done.EDIT: Just so you know, I\\'m almost 99% of the time, a bucket of smiles. Always smiling, always helping people out. Being the best I can be, give it my all. Always asking if there\\'s anything anyone needs, anything i can do, laughing at everything, big bright smiles. That\\'s what hurts me the most. I\\'m so happy to be with everyone, and their attitude towards me is what kills me. It\\'s been years of me \"not caring\", but i\\'m tired.

I have good friends, and they know about my depression just like my family does, and they have tried to help. I feel so selfish and ashamed for not accepting the help that they offer, or at least, not being able to. I can\\'t just make myself feel better. I know this pain is temporary but the if anyone has ever been in this situation, they know that it\\'s damn near intolerable. I thought that I was making one good friend, but I have to accept that he may have gotten tired of talking to me. I just can\\'t bare to start again.

I don\\'t want to get into it but basically it involved me eating an undisclosed number of prescription pills and, upon realizing they weren\\'t going to kill me, pleading with the Lord to take me. Just end my miserable life and take me away from all the horrible people who claim they love me but scream they couldn\\'t care less with their actions. Upon finding out I tried to commit suicide a friend first yelled then cried at me. Told me how horrible it is to lose someone and then realize there was something he could have done but didn\\'t. Not only is this person my friend but they are my new live-in roommate. I apologized and explained why I wanted to commit suicide. I\\'m a very anxious person and for the last two weeks he\\'s been asking me to \"grin and bear it\" as his girlfriend essentially invades my home. I grinned and beared it for as long as I could, but then when I tried, in the gentlest way I knew how, to suggest that she needed to not be at my house so much he bullies me into putting up with it, which only makes me feel MORE violated. MORE taken advantage of. The thing is..... His girlfriend has now been here for the last 48 hours solid. He told me he\\'s lost friends due to suicide and regretted not doing something about it. I straight up told him what I needed to not go to that dark place and it\\'s like he cranked it up a notch. I am convinced more then ever that he wants me to kill myself. How do you fricken reconcile this blatant bullshit? \"I wish I could save you....but also, fuck you.\"? There\\'s a very simple answer to this supposed predicament. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Leave me in peace. STOP making me uncomfortable by permanently inviting a woman who has disrespected me in my own home several times. Even my husband who is so laid back he\\'s practically dead turned to me this morning and told me he doesn\\'t like her. She\\'s too entitled. TOO spoiled. Her attitude is that WE are in the wrong for not inviting her with open arms AS she waltzes in our home without so much as saying hello to us EVERY FRICKEN DAY for the past 2 and 1/2 weeks. It\\'s like there are soulless monsters inhabiting my home. We give, they take. We don\\'t give, they take. We ask, they blow up like we are insane people and it\\'s literally driving me to the brink.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

It wasn\\'t until recently that the thought of following through made me feel better. Now, when I\\'m feeling particularly low during the day, the thought minimizes a lot of the negative feelings. When I remind myself that, some day, I\\'m going to kill myself, a lot of the pain and self loathing dissipates temporarily. I have to assume that this isn\\'t healthy.There are a few reasons I haven\\'t yet killed myself. Maybe you can relate to this list:* Fear that I\\'ll fail. The percentage of successful suicide attempts is extremely low. I\\'ve tried to hang myself two times. The belt buckle broke under my weight both times. I learned how to tie a noose out of electrical cord. It\\'s in my dresser.* Fear that it will hurt. Self-explanatory. I\\'m terrified that the last thing I\\'ll experience will be excruciating physical pain.* My family will miss me.* Fear that people/friends/family will think I killed myself for attention. Fuck people who say this shit. My sister slit her wrists late last year. My mom still claims that it was \"petty\" and that she did it for attention. Thankfully, my sister lived. I don\\'t know if my mom has expressed these opinions to her, but the fact that she actually seems to think that is unsettling.* I don\\'t want my family (or anybody) to find my body. I\\'ll be decaying, with shit and piss in my pants, very likely. I imagine there are fewer things worse than finding a hanged body.Can anybody recommend some good books on existentialism? I\\'m not looking for feel-good books or anything religious. I don\\'t want to learn how to win friends and influence people, either. I want to understand (or disprove) my ever present feelings of hopelessness, nihilism, and my contempt for humankind.Advice welcome.Before stating a label, write out reasoning using the grid above about why this may/may not be entrapment, then state the label as the final word in your output:\\nA: ',\n",

I dont want anything out of life besides happiness and i just cant seem to have that. The only thing in my life that ever made me truly happy was my girlfriend and now shes not in love me anymore apparently. I know this might sound like some high school bullshit but she was the only reason i have been trying at life and getting my shit straight. I was in this hole for so long, and she was with me threw the whole thing. But now that i am actually climbing out of this hole she does this? It feels like she pushed me back down. Only this time i just wanna lay down here and rot. I feel like if _PERSON_ were to give me 1 Billion dollar right now it wouldn\\'t change my state of mind in the slightest. For fucking real you guys, i was so down and out of it for over a year and i just started feeling like i can do this now, go threw life, and i started feeling more happy and better about myself. I could actually take my GF out on a date. Now boom. Right back to square fucking one. Good thing i made an appointment to talk to someone about how i feel a week ago, doing that tomorrow.

I\\'ve been feeling like this for too damn long and don\\'t think it\\'s worth it anymore.\\nA: no\\nQ: [I want someone to talk to] I feel like a pathetic asshole asking for this but I know I need to I\\'ve been drinking tonight and going back and forth I know I\\'m not going to do anything but I also want to feel like someone gives a shit and I don\\'t feel like I have anyone I can really depend on my friends are not people I feel like I can rely on 100% and my family I don\\'t want to burden with my pain I just want someone to listen and I don\\'t care if they really care or not but I want to feel like someone does care ... I\\'m sorry I don\\'t want to burden anyone but when I drink it feels like the only time I have the courage to ask anyone to help me...\\nA: no\\nQ: [I never thought I\\'d have to come back here but...here I am.] For the past almost two years, I was starting to do better. Last week, my 15 month relationship with a great guy ended. I was still having thoughts of wanting to end it and flares of my depression, but I thought I was happy enough that they went away. Now I\\'m here again. My whole body feels heavy and I just want the pain to end, I want me to end. I don\\'t know what to do. If there\\'s someone here, please help me. I don\\'t want to feel like this anymore.\\nA: no\\nQ: [I want to not be alive for the stupidest fucking reason] I\\'ve been living in denial for probably around two years. Now I\\'m no longer in denial, and I just want to stop existing. I don\\'t want to kill myself, God knows I\\'m too much of a bloody coward to do that, but I just want to stop being alive. I want to dress all in black and go out on the highway, hoping someone will bit me. I want to turn on the gas stove and go to bed. I want to get a fake gun and see if a police officer will shoot me. All over a tucking girl. I\\'ve known her for four years, loved her for three and been chasing her for about two. If I die, no one would miss me. I\\'ve lived with the people here for maybe two weeks before they left, they\\'d barely notice a difference. None of my \"friends\" would miss me. No one ever talks to me, I ALWAYS talk to them. I can\\'t remember the last time someone contacted me that I didn\\'t somehow start. I\\'m pretty sure the only thing that girl would think is \"Hey, that fat fuck isn\\'t here anymore.\" Even my parents hate me. I\\'ve got no one. I haven\\'t even had God for a while.And I know what you are going to say. \"She isn\\'t worth it, other fish in the sea,\" and all that crap. I don\\'t believe it. Don\\'t even know why I\\'m posting this. Hell, the only reason anyone would pretend to give a shit is me doing this.\\nA: no\\nQ: [Stressed Out Almost Everyday] I\\'m stressed out. In school, in my home. I don\\'t know what to do. I can\\'t concentrate on my schoolworks. I tried to get rid of the stress. At some point, it went away but after a week or so, I get all stressed again. I don\\'t know what to do. I feel like I can\\'t do anything cause of this stress.I feel like the stress is making my life more miserable. I feel like no one will listen to me. My friends stabbed me in the back. My family hates me seeing stressing myself out. I just wanna scream and shout!!!!!\\nA: no\\nQ: [Been lonely. Had a friend over last night. She left this morning...] And I have literally lost all motivation to do anything again. We didn\\'t sleep much, so I fell asleep on the couch again once she left, but then couldnt motivate myself to do anything for the rest of the day. All I\\'ve done today is lay in bed. I\\'m just really sad. I haven\\'t had a friend over in ages before last night and now I\\'m back to being a lonely emotional wreck.\\nA: no\\n\\nQ: [Can\\'t sleep, past will eat me.] Hello. Hope this is the right place. It\\'s about 3:30 here, given up on waking at 7:00 this morning to go to the clinic. So, going to write here. I grew up in Arizona. Wasn\\'t born there, I was born in Montreal, QC, Canada, (where I am now), but, I lived over 12 years there. My stepfather was abusive, only to me, because my mother had told him at the start that if he hit her, she would divorce him, and because my sister was too pure, I suppose. I have a few memories that pop up from time to time, lots of stuff from my sister, though, as the experience made me repress most of my childhood...I do not remember anything before I was 13 in any coherency, I do not know any of my old teachers, for example. Anyways, not really the point, as what\\'s going wrong started around the time that I can remember, when I was 13. I had been trying to get a \\'girlfriend\\' for a long time, probably to be cool or such, who knows. I had talked with girls a bit, most didn\\'t like me too much. I was passingly curious about homosexual activities, but my thoughts were on girls. I found out that there was a guy who was gay (gasp) at my school, and I eventually talked to him. I asked him about all sorts of stuff, curiosity coming out, and, well, I mentioned my parents weren\\'t home, and that was my first sexual experience. I later found out that he was essentially the ringleader of the gays in my school, being the only non-closeted. I had a few more encounters with him, few because he was not attracted to me, and would insult me before, during and after the experience, which wasn\\'t fun. He \\'set me up\\' with some of the other closeted guys...4 in total, I think, and I had experiences with them as well. That\\'s how I started being the school slut. Fast forward three years, and I had been fucked by 10 other guys, I\\'d never top for various reasons. I had some relationships during that time, but not very strong ones, as I was a slut first and foremost. Recently (January 2012), I eventually fell in love with someone I had known for over a year. And another person I had known for the same time, at the same time. They did not know each other, I loved them both, and did not know which to pursue. I tried for both. About July 2012, I let it break that I loved them both, had them talk ,and, after tears and fighting, we entered a sort of three-way relationship. By this point, I was aware that my past might hurt them, so I told them that I \\'hated anal\\', so I wouldn\\'t endanger them too much. They brought my total to 12. More recently (3 weeks ago), one eventually had me make a choice between them, I chose one over the other, tried to help the one who was not chosen, talking to him lots, ect, ect. I\\'ve remained on pretty good terms with him, he wants to re-enter, obviously that\\'s a problem and all, but, lots of stress for everyone around. Also, recently (January 2013) moved back to Montreal to live with my father and go to University here (Concordia). I got my health card about a week ago, and booked an appointment with my school\\'s clinic (free healthcare and whatnot). Told them what I needed, did the urine test, was supposed to do the blood test tomorrow, but, as stated, can\\'t sleep, so, will probably do it Saturday. That\\'s the one I\\'m afraid of. Because there is a damn high chance I have HIV in me and don\\'t know it yet. Especially because of my first encounter, as that guy had fucked every closeted gay in school. Which was dozens. I\\'ll be getting the results on the 13th, I believe. I take the subway home...but I promised the one I did not choose that I would not do anything the day I find out, to at least talk to them beforehand, and give closure...he says it\\'s to convince me otherwise, but...anyways. If that test comes back positive, I know I will be emotionally wrecked...well, more than that, my life is gone. There\\'s no telling when it\\'d develop to AIDS and kill me painfully...I\\'d likely drop out of school. Just... *sigh* Hello. I\\'ve attempted suicide before, due to my stepfather\\'s abuse and all that...failed attempts, but real ones. And I think this would be worse than anything he could have done. So...after thinking things over, I guess I really don\\'t want to die. I know I will, if it comes back positive, I will want it with a passion, but I don\\'t now. And that\\'s why I\\'m here. Because I don\\'t want to hurt the people I love, and I don\\'t know if I can stop it.

My grades are not great, but they aren\\'t terrible either, I\\'m not not fat, but I\\'m not ripped either. But for some reason, for some reason un-fucking-known to me, I can\\'t make friends at all. I try really hard to be social, and make friends. I go to the parties, but always feel uncomfortable, I try to drink and smoke, but hate every second of it. And every time I try to talk to someone, I can feel them looking right through me, looking down on me, and just a look that makes me feel like I would be better off dead.Then Finally, finally I find a group of people who I think want to be friends with me. then, even they start not inviting me to hang out, and they start looking down on me like all the other, and I can\\'t say anything to them because then I just seem like a weak pussy. Yet all I want to do is just scream STOP and to go back to how it used to be. I just feel so trapped, I feel like I can\\'t improve in any sense, I can\\'t get the grades I want, I can\\'t get the body I want, I can\\'t even make the friends I want. Everything I try, ends up in failure. I just feel so fucking trapped and I can see a way out, I can see the way out of it all, just letting it all go, but I just so fucking scared to go... WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO!? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME!? WHY CAN\\'T I BE FUCKING NORMAL!?\\nA: yes\\nQ: [If you\\'re close to killing yourself, there\\'s always one good reason why you shouldn\\'t do it] \\nA: no\\nQ: [I have nothing left to give, and what\\'s left is an empty shell.] I am not good enough at anything to be able to get a job doing anything I actually enjoy.By the time I might be good enough at something, there will be at least 753 more people who are stillbetter than me.I will never be enough. I will never be good enough to have a job doing something I enjoy.I will never be enough for a girl to be attracted to.I will never have enough skill or ability to make something good or even decent.There is nothing about me that is or ever will be enough.I have had enough.I have tried as hard as I can to live in this world.I have tried as hard as I can to figure out what it is that I want in this world.But anything I want to do is wildly invalid and impractical.And it would not be enough to allow me to survive doing it.In order to make it anywhere in this world, I would have to do something that makes meemotionally and at times physically ill, or at least it would have to be something that drains all senseof individuality I have left.I do not even know who \"I\" am any more. I think I have some ideas what I want to do.But, again, those things that I might want to do are all things that are not worth following because theywill never allow me to support myself and be a productive member of society.So the only way I can support myself and live in this world is to do things that erase any sense of selfand turn me into a cog in the machine or a robot with no soul.I just want to be in the world and make people laugh and make them happy.That is all I have ever wanted in this world.But that is something I will never be able to do.I see no reason to continue living.I will never be able to do something that makes me happy because anything I try to do or makewill never be enough. It will not be good enough, nor will it be funny enough.None of my efforts are worthwhile.I do not want to continue fighting the unwinnable fight.I know that there is \"The Impossible Dream\" motivation, but that is not enough.Because, again, I will never be enough.I will not ever be enough.Nothing I will ever make will be enough.There is no point in continuing the struggle.I have tried as hard as I possibly could. I have done everything I could think of.But even then I could not do enough.There is no point.There is nothing left.I am finished.\\nA: yes\\nQ: [Probably gonna swallow the pills soon] I don\\'t really know what to say. I feel like I should go to the hospital but I don\\'t feel like I should unless I actually hurt myself. It\\'s silly you know? People go to suicide wards for attempts, not for saying they\\'re suicidal. But this is not the point. I feel like I have no reason to live. I want to see what death is like. I feel so bad these days that I can\\'t even look forward to the things I used to. I\\'m transgender and face harassment constantly. My fianc√© doesn\\'t approve of me being polysexual because I figured out that I was in the middle of the relationship, he is insisting on keeping the relationship monogamous. I used to tell myself that if I ever felt like death was the only option that I would run away and enjoy myself by camping forever. I don\\'t even see a purpose to that now either. I\\'m only a few days from graduating high school and I don\\'t even care. I am supposed to move to asheville with my fianc√© and attend college. I was so excited and now I just feel trapped and like there isn\\'t even a purpose any more. I think I\\'m gonna take all of my meds (lamictal, Zoloft, and seroquil) and see if that works. I think while I fall asleep forever that I will listen to the unicorns \"who will cut our hair when we\\'re gone?\" Album. I don\\'t know why I\\'m posting here. I don\\'t know what else to do. I can\\'t tell anyone else.\\nA: yes\\nQ: [I\\'m 20 years old and i have an acceptance of death and I feel alone all of the time] I\\'ve felt for a long time that id be completely okey with dying.
