RUN FROM ROOT

This script processes a CSV file containing research paper information, retrieves reference data from the Semantic Scholar API, 
and visualizes the citation graph and citation counts.

The SemanticScholarAPI class handles interactions with the Semantic Scholar API, including getting paper references and citation counts.
It uses rate limiting and exponential backoff to handle API rate limits and errors.

The ArxivAPI class retrieves paper titles from the arXiv API given an arXiv ID.

The PaperProcessor class processes the CSV file, extracts paper IDs (either directly from Semantic Scholar or by converting arXiv IDs), 
and retrieves the references for each paper using the SemanticScholarAPI. It can also process additional papers given a list of titles.

The GraphVisualizer class visualizes the citation graph, showing the most referenced papers and their connections. 
It applies techniques like adjusting node overlap, wrapping long titles, and scaling node sizes based on the number of incoming citations.
It can also visualize a bar chart of the citation counts for different techniques.

The Main class ties everything together. It loads the API key from a .env file, initializes the other classes, and provides methods to:
1. Process the initial CSV file
2. Process additional papers 
3. Merge the reference data
4. Clean the merged data (remove references to papers not in the dataset)
5. Visualize the citation graph

To use this script:
1. Set your Semantic Scholar API key in a .env file as SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY.
2. Prepare a Master Papers CSV 
3. Update the 'titles' list with any additional papers to include.
4. Update the 'technique_to_title' dictionary to map paper titles to the techniques they represent.
5. Run the script, uncommenting the desired methods in the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' block.

The script will save the processed data to JSON files at each step, and display the visualizations using matplotlib and the graph as a PNG.


May need to uncomment some stuff at the bottom for this to work."""
