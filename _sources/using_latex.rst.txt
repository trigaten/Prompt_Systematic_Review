Using LaTeX
=========================

LaTeX is a typesetting language commonly used for creating documents with complex formatting, such as research papers 
and scientific articles. For our collaborative document editing, we will be using Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor that 
allows multiple people to work on a document simultaneously. If you need access to the LaTeX repository for our project, 
please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your sub team lead.

Here are some basic formatting tips with LaTeX:

1. **Section Headings**: You can create section headings using LaTeX by starting a line with a series of `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols determines the section level. For example, `#` is a top-level section, `##` is a subsection, and so on.

2. **Italics and Bold**: To make text italic, you can use `\\textit{}` and to make text bold, you can use `\\textbf{}`. For example, `\\textit{italic text}` and `\\textbf{bold text}`.


Here are some tips for our project:


1. Cite everything! Every time you refer to information from an external source, you need to cite it. 
Use bibtex and put your citation in custom.bib. To cite a reference, use the LaTeX `\\cite{bib_title}` command, where `bib_title` is the key or label of the reference in your bibliography.
