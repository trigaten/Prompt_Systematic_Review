Using Git/Github
=========================

Git and Github are important tools for collaborative coding projects. Here's a basic guide:

1. **Git Basics**: Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. You need to have Git installed on your computer. Learn a few commands like `git clone` (to get a copy of the project), `git pull` (to get the latest changes), `git push` (to share your changes), and `git commit` (to save your work).

2. **Github**: Github is a platform where we store our code, which is based on Git.

3. **Cloning a Repository**: To start working on a project, use `git clone https://github.com/trigaten/Prompt_Systematic_Review.git` to bring the project to your computer. 

4. **Branches and Pull Requests**: When you want to change something in the project, create a "branch." It's like creating a separate workspace for your ideas. After you're done, you can ask others to review your work by making a "pull request." It's like getting feedback from others before your changes become part of the main project.

5. **Commit Messages**: When you make changes, write clear and simple messages about what you did. Use `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or your sub-team leader.

Note that our Github repo has a CI pipeline, which automatically runs tests, style checks, and more when you request you merge new code.
This helps ensure that broken code does not get merged in.
