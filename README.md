# Prompt Engineering Survey

## Install requirements

after cloning, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from root

## Setting up API keys

Make a file at root called `.env`.

For OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart 
For Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens, also run `huggingface-cli login`
For Sematic Scholar: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key 

Use the reference `example.env` file to fill in your API keys/tokens. 
`OPENAI_API_KEY=sk.-...`
`SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY=...`
`HF_TOKEN=...`

## Setting up keys for running tests
Then to load the .env file, type:
pip install pytest-dotenv

You can also choose to update the env file by doing:
py.test --envfile path/to/.env

In the case that you have several .env files, create a new env_files in the pytest config folder and type:

env_files =
.env
.test.env
.deploy.env

## Structure of the Repository
The script `main.py` calls the necessary functions to download all the papers, deduplicate and filter them, and then run all the experiments. 

The core of the repository is in `src/prompt_systematic_review`. The `config_data.py` script contains configurations that are important for running experiments and saving time. You can see in `main.py` how some of these options are used. 

The source folder is divided into 4 main sections: 3 scripts (`automated_review.py`, `collect_papers.py`,`config_data.py`) that deal with collecting the data and running the automated review, the `utils` folder that contains utility functions that are used throughout the repository, the `get_papers` folder that contains the scripts to download the papers, and the `experiments` folder that contains the scripts to run the experiments. 

At the root, there is a `data` folder. It comes pre-loaded with some data that is used for the experiments, however the bulk of the dataset can either be generated by running `main.py` or by downloading the data from huggingface. It is in `data/experiments_output` that the results of the experiments are saved.

Notably, the keywords used in the automated review/scraping process are in `src/prompt_systematic_review/utils/keywords.py`. Anyone who wishes to run the automated review can adjust these keywords to their liking in that file. 

## Running the code
Running `main.py` will download the papers, run the automated review, and run the experiments.
However, if you wish to save time and only run the experiments, you can download the data from huggingface and move the papers folder into the data folder (should look like `data/papers/*.pdf`). Adjust main.py accordingly. 

Every experiment script has a `run_experiment` function that is called in `main.py`. The `run_experiment` function is responsible for running the experiment and saving the results. However each script can be run individually by just running `python src/prompt_systematic_review/experiments/<experiment_name>.py` from root. 

There is one experiment, `graph_internal_references` that, because of weird issues with parallelism, is better run from root as an individual script. To avoid it causing issues with other experiments, it is run last as it is ordered at the bottom of the list in `experiments/__init__.py`.



## Notes

- Sometimes a paper title may appear differently on the arXiv API. For example, "Visual Attention-Prompted Prediction and Learning" (arXiv:2310.08420), according to arXiv API is titled "A visual encoding model based on deep neural networks and transfer learning"
